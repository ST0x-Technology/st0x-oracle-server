# st0x Oracle Server

Signed context oracle server for st0x tokenized equities on [Raindex](https://rainlang.xyz).

Serves `SignedContextV1` data using real-time Alpaca NBBO quotes, enabling Raindex orders to price tokenized equities at executable hedging prices without on-chain oracle gas costs.

## How it works

1. A background loop polls Alpaca every `poll_interval_secs` (default 10s) for every configured symbol and caches the quote alongside its Alpaca-reported timestamp.
2. On each `POST /context/v1`, the server decodes the ABI-encoded request body, resolves the input/output tokens to an Alpaca ticker via the token registry, and serves the **cached** quote — it never hits Alpaca synchronously.
3. Selects the executable price (ask for buys, `1/bid` for sells), encoding the inversion in Rain DecimalFloat precision (not f64).
4. Encodes `[schema_version, price, publish_time]` as Rain DecimalFloats where `publish_time` is Alpaca's own quote timestamp (NOT our fetch time).
5. Signs via EIP-191 and returns a JSON array of `OracleResponse` whose length matches the request length.

If Alpaca is temporarily unreachable, the poll loop logs the error and leaves the previous cached quote in place. The Rainlang strategy bounds freshness via a `max-staleness` guard against `block.timestamp`.

### Signature cache

Every slot the oracle signs (price, publish time, session window, token
addresses, quote expiry) comes from the pricing frame and the requested
pair, never from the wall clock or the caller. Two requests for the same
pair inside one price frame therefore sign byte-identical data, and the
server keeps a content-addressed cache (`keccak256` of the packed context
→ signature, 2-minute TTL, 16k entries) so the second request reuses the
first signature instead of paying for another KMS operation. Concurrent
identical requests coalesce onto one sign call. Consumers see nothing
different: same bytes, a valid signature, the same expiry.
`oracle_signature_cache_hits_total` / `_misses_total` and
`oracle_signature_cache_entries` on `/metrics` show the effect.

## Usage

```bash
# Enter nix dev shell
nix develop

# Run with secrets in env + config.toml on disk
SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x... \
ALPACA_API_KEY_ID=... \
ALPACA_API_SECRET_KEY=... \
cargo run -- --config config.toml
```

### Environment variables (secrets only)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY` | Hex private key for EIP-191 signing |
| `ALPACA_API_KEY_ID` | Alpaca read-only API key |
| `ALPACA_API_SECRET_KEY` | Alpaca API secret |

### config.toml

Everything non-secret lives in `config.toml` at the repo root:

```toml
port = 3000
poll_interval_secs = 10

[[tokens]]
address = "0x5cDa0E1CA4ce2af96315f7F8963C85399c172204"
symbol  = "COIN"
```

USDC on Base is hardcoded as the quote token in `src/main.rs` — it's a chain invariant.

### Endpoint

```http
POST /context/v1
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
```

Accepts either form (matching upstream `rain.orderbook/crates/quote/src/oracle.rs`):

- **Single**: ABI-encoded `(OrderV4, uint256 inputIOIndex, uint256 outputIOIndex, address counterparty)`
- **Batch**:  ABI-encoded `(OrderV4, uint256, uint256, address)[]`

The response is always a JSON array of `OracleResponse`, with length matching the request:

```json
[
  {
    "signer": "0x...",
    "context": ["0x...", "0x...", "0x..."],
    "signature": "0x..."
  }
]
```

Schema v1 context layout (all Rain DecimalFloats):
- `context[0]`: schema version (= 1)
- `context[1]`: price (ask for buys, `1/bid` for sells)
- `context[2]`: publish_time — Alpaca's own quote timestamp as Unix seconds UTC

The old `/context` endpoint has been removed; it now returns `404`.

### Price direction

The server automatically determines price direction from the order's IO tokens:

- **Buy tStock** (input=USDC, output=tStock): returns **ask price** (cost to buy)
- **Sell tStock** (input=tStock, output=USDC): returns **1/bid price** (inverted in Rain Float precision)

This ensures the on-chain price matches what can be immediately hedged on Alpaca.
